- Easy to customize colors, styling, and content
- Support for dynamic data injection

### **Notification Rules**

- Branch-specific targeting is automatic
- No manual configuration required

### **Rate Limiting**

- System handles API quotas gracefully
- Failed emails are logged for debugging

## Error Handling

### **Common Issues**
1. **Gmail API Not Enabled**
   - Error: "Gmail API not enabled"
   - Solution: Enable Gmail API in Google Cloud Console

2. **Invalid Credentials**
   - Error: "Authentication failed"
   - Solution: Verify service account credentials

- Email errors are logged but don't break the booking process
- Failed email attempts are included in API responses

## Testing

### **1. Test Email Service**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/test-email-service?branch_id=123"
```

### **2. Test with Sample Data**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/send-email-notifications" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "notification_type": "booking_created",
    "booking_data": {
      "booking_id": "TEST-123",
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "time": "14:00:00",
      "status": "scheduled"
    },
    "client_details": {
      "name": "Test Client",
      "email": "test@example.com"
    },
    "branch_details": {
      "name": "Test Branch"
    },
    "services_details": {
      "services": [],
      "totalCost": 0
    }
  }'
```

### **3. Check Service Status**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/email-service-status"
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### **Logs to Watch**
```javascript
// Email service initialization
console.log('Gmail API initialized successfully');

// Account discovery
console.log(`Found ${accounts.length} accounts to notify`);

// Email sending results
console.log(`Email notifications sent successfully:`, emailNotificationResult);

// Failed emails
console.error(`Failed to send email to ${email}:`, error);
```

### **Response Fields**
```javascript
{
  "email_notifications": {
    "success": true,
    "emails_sent": 5,
    "total_accounts": 5,
    "failed_emails": 0,
    "results_by_role": {
      "master_admin": { "total": 2, "successful": 2, "failed": 0 },
      "branch": { "total": 3, "successful": 3, "failed": 0 }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### **Email Content**
- No sensitive information in email content
- Booking IDs are used instead of internal IDs
- Client contact information is included for operational purposes

### **Access Control**
- Only authorized users receive notifications
- Branch-specific filtering prevents information leakage
- Role-based access ensures appropriate notification levels

### **API Security**
- Email service uses service account authentication
- No user credentials stored or transmitted
- Secure Gmail API integration

## Performance Optimization

### **Batch Processing**
- Multiple emails sent concurrently using Promise.all
- Efficient account filtering by role and branch
- Minimal database queries for account information

### **Caching**
- Service account authentication is cached
- Account information is fetched once per notification
- Gmail API client is reused for multiple emails

### **Error Recovery**
- Failed emails don't block successful ones
- Individual email failures are logged separately
- System continues operation even if some emails fail

## Troubleshooting

### **Email Not Received**
1. Check Gmail API is enabled
2. Verify service account has Gmail permissions
3. Check email service logs for errors
4. Verify account email addresses are correct

### **Service Not Initializing**
1. Check environment variables
2. Verify Google service account credentials
3. Ensure Gmail API is enabled
4. Check network connectivity to Google APIs

### **Partial Email Delivery**
1. Check Gmail API quotas
2. Review failed email logs
3. Verify recipient email addresses
4. Check for Gmail API rate limiting

## Support and Maintenance

### **Regular Checks**
- Monitor Gmail API quotas
- Check email delivery success rates
- Review failed email logs
- Verify service account permissions

### **Updates**
- Email templates can be updated without code changes
- New notification types can be added easily
- Role-based rules are configurable
- Branch filtering is automatic

### **Backup Plans**
- System continues operation if email fails
- Failed notifications are logged for manual review
- Alternative notification methods can be added
- Graceful degradation ensures system reliability
